## Overview

SAPPDiscordBot listens for **server events** generated by
the [discord.lua](https://github.com/Chalwk/SAPPDiscordBot/releases/latest/download/discord.lua), processes them, and
sends rich notifications to Discord. It supports **multiple servers**, offers a **GUI** for configuration, and is
optimized for performance.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This application requires GUI access to the host machine. It will **not** run in headless environments
> such as servers without a graphical interface.

### Download and Installation

**1.** Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Chalwk/SAPPDiscordBot/releases) from the repository

**2.** Download the [discord.lua](https://github.com/Chalwk/SAPPDiscordBot/releases/latest/download/discord.lua) and
place it in the server *Lua folder*

**3.** Register an application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Follow these steps:

- Click **New Application**.
  Provide a name for your bot and click **create**.
- Click the **Bot** tab on the left-hand side menu.
  Set the bot's username and profile picture.

    - Under **Bot Permissions**, select **Administrator**
    - Copy the URL that gets generated and paste it into your browser.
- Select the server you want to add the bot to and click **Continue**.
    - Complete the captcha and click **Authorize**.
    - The bot should now be on your Discord server. Ensure the bot has the correct permissions.

> ⚠️ Warning: Never share the Discord Bot Token with anyone!

**4.** Create a new folder in your Halo server's root directory called `discord_events`.

**5.** Launch `SAPPDiscordBot.exe` (or `SAPPDiscordBot.jar` on Linux)
